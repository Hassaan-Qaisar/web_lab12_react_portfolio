**React Portfolio Website**
This repository contains the code for my React-based portfolio website, developed as a requirement for the Web Engineering course.

**Overview**
This project showcases a personal portfolio website built using React for the frontend and Express.js with MongoDB for the backend. The website includes sections for home, about, projects, resume, and a clean footer. The frontend features animated elements, particle effects, and Bootstrap styling for a visually appealing design.
